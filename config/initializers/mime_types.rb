# We monkey patch the Rails MIME content negotiator to not take the `BROWSER_LIKE_ACCEPTS` shortcut:
# https://www.bigbinary.com/blog/mime-type-resolution-in-rails#case-1-http-accept-is. There has been much written about
# this issue:
#   * "Multiple accept headers' specificity is misinterpreted" - https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/9940.
#   * "Fix broken Accept header parsing and content negotiation" - https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/14540.
#   * The monkey patch itself - https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/9940#issuecomment-374936185.
#
# This resolves strange behavior like the axios HTTP library receiving an HTML response from some Rails controller's
# `respond_to` block just because it includes `*/*` in `Accept`:
# https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/dbc634c/lib/defaults.js#L105-L109.
